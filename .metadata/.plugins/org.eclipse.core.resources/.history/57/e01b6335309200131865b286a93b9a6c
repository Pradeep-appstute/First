The Town Hall of Maastricht is the town of Maastricht . From the 1662 revival-styled building, designed by Pieter Post is an important example of the Dutch Classicism . With Namur stone clad, detached building is located in the middle of the market and has a westward-looking monumental staircase.
nnThe contract to build the town hall in 1655 by the city council passed to Pieter Post. In 1659 came Mail from The Hague to Maastricht to the best place to find the new town hall to post. He chose the middle of the market, but in order to do the Cloth Hall , the Belfry , part of the city wall with the Lie Gate, the Prison and some houses on the market districts. The names of two adjoining streets "Small Canal" and "Grand Canal" still refer to the course of the first walls of Maastricht. By this demolition was a market square, where in the middle the new town would come. The stones were from the Prison are used in the foundations of the new city hall.
nnThe design of the town hall takes into account the two men, the Duke of Brabant and the prince-bishop of Liège to Maastricht until the end of the 17th century ruled. The left side of the building is the Brabant side, while the right side contains the Liège rooms. These are the main side because the prince-bishop higher in rank than the Duke.
